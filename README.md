Named-entity datasets and GloVe models for the Armenian language

>In this work, we tackle the problem of Armenian
named entity recognition, providing silver- and gold-standard
datasets as well as establishing baseline results on popular models.
We present a 163000-token named entity corpus automatically
generated and annotated from Wikipedia, and another 53400-
token corpus of news sentences with manual annotation of people,
organization and location named entities. The corpora were used
to train and evaluate several popular named entity recognition
models. Alongside the datasets, we release 50-, 100-, 200-, 300-
dimensional GloVe word embeddings trained on a collection of
Armenian texts from Wikipedia, news, blogs, and encyclopedia
